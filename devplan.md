# Development Plan for Backend and Frontend WebSocket Project

## Summary of Decisions

- **Backend:** Python server connecting to LM Studio Server for streaming AI model responses and managing on-demand MCP/document server connections.
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript and Material UI.
- **State Management:** React Context + `useReducer` initially.
- **WebSocket Communication:** React-specific WebSocket hook library for frontend; Python backend WebSocket server.
- **Future AI System Design:** Incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector databases, caching, security, and scalability.

## Development Plan and Todos

### Backend

1. **Setup Basic WebSocket Server**
   - Choose Python WebSocket framework (`websockets`, `FastAPI` with WebSocket, or `Starlette`).
   - Implement WebSocket server to accept client connections and handle messages.
   - Manage connection lifecycle events (open, message, close, error).

2. **Connect Backend to LM Studio Server**
   - Define connection and authentication methods to LM Studio.
   - Stream model responses to frontend clients efficiently.
   - Include error handling and message passing robustness.

3. **Implement On-Demand MCP Server Connections**
   - Design connection/session management for MCP servers.
   - Define protocols and formats for MCP data interaction.

4. **Plan for Vector DB and RAG Integration**
   - Research vector database options compatible with Python.
   - Design document ingestion and embedding pipelines.
   - Create retrieval workflows to augment LM Studio model responses (future iteration).

5. **Implement Security & Scaling Considerations**
   - Plan authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections.
   - Design resource management, connection pooling, and graceful failure mechanisms.

### Frontend

1. **Initialize React Project with TypeScript**
   - Scaffold React project using Create React App or Vite with TypeScript.
   - Integrate Material UI component library.

2. **Implement React Context + useReducer for State Management**
   - Setup global state container for WebSocket status, messages, and app state.
   - Define actions and reducers for realtime data handling.

3. **Integrate React WebSocket Hook Library**
   - Select appropriate React WebSocket hook library with reconnection support.
   - Implement connection to backend WebSocket server.
   - Update UI state with streamed data.

4. **Build Core UI Components using Material UI**
   - Message display and streaming components.
   - Input controls for queries and document/server configuration.
   - Connection status and error notification UI.

5. **Prepare for Future Expansion**
   - UI flows to configure MCP/document sources.
   - Interfaces for displaying RAG-augmented AI responses.

### Collaborative/Project Management

- Define API contracts and message formats between backend and frontend.
- Setup version control and CI/CD pipelines.
- Create staging and test environments for integration.
- Establish monitoring and logging for connection health and errors.
